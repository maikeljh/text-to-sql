The output helps track player mobility and team changes, which could be valuable for transfer analysis or player career tracking. Key modifications could include: 1) Adding player names and team names by joining with additional tables for better context, 2) Including time periods to analyze when players changed teams, or 3) Calculating the average duration per team to understand player stability.

The output ranks referees by the cumulative audience size of matches they've overseen, which could be valuable for assessing referee experience with high-profile matches. Key modifications could include: 1) Adding referee names by joining with a referees table for better identification, 2) Calculating average audience per match to account for referees who've officiated many matches, or 3) Filtering by tournament or season to analyze trends over time.
