  HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT m.id_jurusan) = 1;","This SQL query identifies clubs (klub) whose members all come from a single academic department (jurusan), highlighting potentially department-exclusive clubs. It joins the OrganisasiKlub, KeanggotaanKlub, and Mahasiswa tables, using GROUP BY to aggregate by club and department, and HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT m.id_jurusan) = 1 to enforce the single-department condition. Key operations include JOINs for table relationships and HAVING for post-aggregation filtering. The output lists club IDs, names, and their uniform department IDs, useful for identifying department-affiliated clubs or assessing diversity in club membership. Modifications could include: 1) Adding department names for readability, 2) Counting members per club to assess size, or 3) Filtering for specific departments of interest. This query could answer questions like 'Which clubs are exclusively associated with a particular department?' or 'Are there clubs that could benefit from more diverse departmental representation?'","WhIHcLUBSzz HAve olYSTdEntszz froM The SAE dEPaRTmENT?
