  HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT team_id) > 1;","This SQL query identifies goalkeepers who have played for multiple teams by analyzing the match_details table. The query counts the distinct team associations for each goalkeeper (player_gk) and filters for those who have played for more than one team (HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT team_id) > 1). The output shows goalkeeper IDs and the number of teams they've played for, which is useful for tracking player transfers or loan spells. The query could be enhanced by: 1) Joining with player_mast to include goalkeeper names, 2) Adding match dates to analyze the timeline of team changes, or 3) Including performance metrics to compare across teams. It helps answer questions like 'Which goalkeepers have played for multiple clubs?' or 'How common are goalkeeper transfers between teams?'",Who are the goalkeepers that played for more than one team? Show their player_id and number of teams.,Kiper mana yang pernah main untuk lebih dari satu tim? Saya mau lihat player_id dan jumlah timnya.,"['player_id', 'team_count']"

  HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;","This SQL query analyzes referee assignments by country, identifying countries whose referees have officiated more than 2 matches. It joins the 'match_mast', 'referee_mast', and 'soccer_country' tables to connect match data with referee nationality information. The query counts matches per referee country and filters for countries with more than 2 assignments using GROUP BY and HAVING clauses. The output shows country names and their total match assignments, highlighting nations with significant referee representation. This is valuable for understanding referee distribution patterns and potential biases in officiating assignments. Business applications include referee program development and tournament planning. Potential modifications: 1) add tournament stage information to analyze assignment patterns in key matches, 2) compare with team nationalities to assess potential conflicts, or 3) calculate percentages of total matches officiated. This query helps answer questions like 'Which countries provide the most referees?' or 'Is there equitable distribution of referee assignments across nations?'",Which countries had referees that officiated more than 2 matches? I want the country name and number of matches.,Negara mana yang punya wasit yang memimpin lebih dari 2 pertandingan? Saya mau nama negara dan jumlah pertandingan.,"['country_name', 'match_count']"
Find players who changed clubs but kept the same jersey number. Show player_id and jersey_no.,"SELECT player_id, jersey_no

  HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT playing_club) > 1;","This SQL query identifies players who have worn the same jersey number for multiple clubs by analyzing the 'player_mast' table. It groups records by player_id and jersey_no, then filters for cases where a player has used the same jersey number for more than one club (COUNT(DISTINCT playing_club) > 1). The output helps track player number consistency across clubs, which could be relevant for fan engagement or player branding analysis. Key modifications could include: 1) Adding player names and club names for better identification, 2) Including time periods to analyze number usage over career spans, or 3) Comparing with performance metrics to assess if number consistency correlates with performance. This query could help answer questions like: 'Which players maintain consistent numbers across clubs?', 'Do certain jersey numbers get reused more than others when players transfer?', or 'Is there any relationship between number consistency and player performance?'",Find players who changed teams but kept the same jersey number.
